# # HODDAT PaaS Hub â€“ Local Auth Proxy

Uses [keycloak-proxy](https://github.com/gambol99/keycloak-proxy)

The `local` folder contains scripts to manage a local `keycloak-proxy` instance in a Docker container.

**IMPORTANT:** to allow the Docker container to talk to the API running on your host: set up an alias on your local loopback adapter using `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/24` (needed on every restart of your computer).

Note: you'll need to create/copy a `local/.env.local` file for the Keycloak access credentials and other security related config (automatically picked up by the script(s)). This file must export the following environment variables:
- `KCPROXY_CLIENT_ID`
- `KCPROXY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `KCPROXY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (must be either 16 or 32 characters)

Additionally, you can override the `KCPROXY_UPSTREAM_URL` in your local env file if you have a different setup.
